## 1. Brake Distirbution

- **Course:** ***Vehicle Optimal Design***
    - **Instructors:** Prof. M. Gobbi, Eng. P. Stabile
- **Authors:** G. Biasolo, M. Cigada, F. D'Agostini
-  **Date:** September 2025 - December 2025
- **Keywords:** Brake Distribution Optimization, Simplex Method, fminsearch, Piston Area Ratio, Well-Posedness
- **Software used:** MATLAB
- **Goal of the project:** Optimize the braking distribution of a simplified car model by varying brake piston diameters to minimize the error between ideal and real braking curves. Using the Simplex Method in MATLAB, the study identifies that performance is governed by a constant piston area ratio. Results show the optimization problem is not well-posed as it lacks solution uniqueness, suggesting the need for additional physical constraints in future designs

## 2,3. Passive Suspension

- **Course:** ***Vehicle Optimal Design***
    - **Instructors:** Prof. M. Gobbi, Eng. P. Stabile
- **Authors:** G. Biasolo, M. Cigada, F. D'Agostini
-  **Date:** September 2025 - December 2025
- **Keywords:** Passive Suspension, Quarter Car Model, Pareto Optimal Set, Multi-Objective Optimization, Weighted Sum Method, ε-Constraints Method, Fritz John Conditions, Discomfort, Road Holding
- **Software used:** MATLAB
- **Goal of the project:** The project aims to optimize a passive suspension system by identifying the Pareto optimal set between conflicting objectives: minimizing passenger discomfort and road holding. Using a quarter car model, the study evaluates various optimization strategies—including grid sorting, weighted sum, and ε-constraint methods—validated by an analytical derivation via Fritz John optimality conditions. The results define a design map for selecting optimal combinations of suspension stiffness and damping
