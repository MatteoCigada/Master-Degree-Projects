## 1. Data Analysis of a Racecar 

- **Course:** ***Data Analysis for Future Transportation System***
    - **Instructors:** Prof. P. Chiariotti
- **Authors:** M. Cigada, F. D'Agostini, L. Gazzarrini
- **Date:** September 2024 - December 2024
- **Keywords:** Space/Time Domain Anaysis, Frequency Domain Analysis, Filtering, Power Spectral Density, Coherence, Time Frequency
- **Software used:** MATLAB
- **Goal of the project:** Collect the raw sensors' data in a well-organized dataset, highlight the key differences between a gentlemen driver and a pro-driver, analyze dampers' data in time and frequency domain to characterize the vertical dynamics of the car (first natural frequency has been identified), summarize everything into time frequency analysis
