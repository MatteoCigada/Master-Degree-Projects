## 1. Experimental Modal Analysis

- **Course:** ***Advanced Dynamics of Mechanical Systems***
    - **Instructors:** Prof. R. Corradi, Dr. I. La Paglia
- **Date:** September 2024 - December 2024
- **Keywords:** Experimental Modal Analysis, Cantilever Beam, Light Rail Wheel, Natural Frequencies, Mode Shapes, Frequency Response Functions (FRF), Modal Parameter Identification
- **Software used:** MATLAB
- **Goal of the project:** Analyze the behavior of a cantilever beam and a light rail wheel through the computation and identification of their modal parameters. After validating the procedure used for the cantilever beam by comparing the results with theoretical models, the same methodology has been followed for the light rail wheel

## 2. In-plane Finite Element Model of a Truss Bridge

- **Course:** ***Advanced Dynamics of Mechanical Systems***
    - **Instructors:** Prof. R. Corradi, Dr. I. La Paglia
- **Date:** September 2024 - December 2024
- **Keywords:** Finite Element Model (FEM), Truss Bridge, Natural Frequencies, Mode Shapes, Frequency Response Functions (FRF), Tuned Mass Damper (TMD), Static Response, Critical Velocities
- **Software used:** MATLAB
- **Goal of the project:** Develop an in-plane finite element model of a truss bridge to analyze its dynamic and static behavior. This includes computing natural frequencies and mode shapes, calculating the damping matrix, determining FRFs, designing a Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) for vibration reduction, analyzing static response and estimating the critical velocities
