## 1. Experimental Modal Analysis

- **Course:** ***Advanced Dynamics of Mechanical Systems***
  - **Professor:** Prof. R. Corradi, Dr. I. La Paglia
- **Date:** September 2024 - December 2024
- **Keywords:** Experimental Modal Analysis, Cantilever Beam, Light Rail Wheel, Natural Frequencies, Mode Shapes, Frequency Response Functions (FRF), Modal Parameter Identification
- **Software used:** MATLAB
- **Goal of the project:** Analyze the behavior of a cantilever beam and a light rail wheel through the computation and identification of their modal parameters. After validating the procedure used for the cantilever beam by comparing the results with theoretical models, the same methodology has been followed for the light rail wheel.
