## 3. Preliminary Design of Cruise Control

- **Course:** ***Control of Mechanical Systems***
    - **Instructors:** Prof. E. Sabbioni, Dr. F. Paparazzo
- **Date:** September 2024 - December 2024
- **Keywords:** Cruise Control, PID, Actuator, Multi-DOF system
- **Software used:** MATLAB, Simulink
- **Goal of the project:** Compute the equation of motion (EOM) for a vehichle modelled as a rigid body accounting for road slope and drag resistance force effects, linearize the EOM about a steady state condition, design a PI/PID regulator by tuning the gains based on stability and performance analysis, investigate the impact of an actuator (electric motor) and of a deformable shaft (2 DOF sysyem) on the stability
